Kelaasor Python and Django Boot Camp Team Project

Welcome to our repository for the first team project at the "Kelaasor Python and Django Boot Camp." This project is a simple and practical example created by our mentor to guide you through building a Python project using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

Project Snapshot:
In just one week, we dived into creating a basic program to manage movies, actors, and directors. The main goal was to give users the ability to log in securely, then easily list and search for movies, actors, and directors.

Key Features:

Quick Authentication: Users can log in with a username and password, ensuring a basic yet secure access system.

Object-Oriented Simplicity: The project demonstrates how to use object-oriented programming for a straightforward and easy-to-understand code structure.

Movie Basics: You can perform basic operations like adding, searcing, rating a movie. Plus, there's a simple list of available movies to explore.

Actor and Director Essentials: Manage actor and director data with similar simplicity, making it easy to modify and add entries.

Basic Search Functionality: Find specific movies, actors, or directors with a straightforward search feature.

How to Use:

Get the Code: Clone this repository to your local machine:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kelaasor-python-django-bootcamp.git
```

Setup Steps: Check out the documentation for quick steps to set up the Python and Django environment needed to run the project.

Install Dependencies: Make sure to install the required dependencies, including the new addition. Run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now includes the pwinput library to enhance password input security.

Run and Explore: To start the program, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python main.py
```
This will launch the program, allowing you to explore the basics of user authentication, managing movies, and searching for information.
